# Variational Autoencoder with Restricted Boltzmann Machine pretraining

This code is base on the [repository by Jeremy Lane](https://github.co/lane203j/deep-autoencoder-with-RBM-pretraining) that makes RBM pretraining for autoencoders. 

But here we will apply RBM pretraining to Variational autoencoders.
